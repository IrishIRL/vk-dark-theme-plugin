## What it does
Since VK does not have a dark theme in web, desided to make a small plugin for that purpose. Plugin is made for Mozilla plugin.
This extension changes CSS color elements to the inverted colors.

Planning to make a better custom theme, not just inverted colors.

## What it shows

* some basic page action functions
* how to apply and remove CSS.

This plugin is made out of: https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/apply-css
